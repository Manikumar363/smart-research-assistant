# Dual Mode System: Chat vs Report Generation

## üéØ Overview

The system now supports two distinct modes of operation:
1. **Normal Chat Mode** - Interactive conversation with contextual responses
2. **Report Generation Mode** - Comprehensive reports covering entire conversation history

Both modes use the same core services (QueryRefiner and AnswerAssistant) but with different prompting strategies and processing approaches.

## üîÑ Mode Architecture

### Mode Detection
- **Chat Mode**: Default behavior for `/api/files/research-answer` endpoint
- **Report Mode**: Triggered by `/api/files/generate-report` endpoint
- Both modes use `isReportMode` parameter to switch behavior

### Core Differences

| Aspect | Chat Mode | Report Mode |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Query Refinement** | Single query optimization | Comprehensive topic extraction from conversation |
| **Answer Generation** | Contextual response to current query | Comprehensive report covering all questions |
| **Conversation History** | Recent messages for context | Full conversation history for completeness |
| **Output Length** | Concise, focused answers | Detailed, structured reports |
| **Source Usage** | Relevant to current query | Comprehensive across all topics |
| **Thread Management** | Updates conversation thread | Read-only (doesn't extend conversation) |

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### 1. Normal Chat Flow
```http
POST /api/files/research-answer
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "query": "What are AI ethics concerns?",
  "sessionId": "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3",
  "ensureSessionInit": true,
  "includeFileData": true,
  "includeLiveData": true
}
```

**Processing Flow:**
1. QueryRefiner with normal mode prompts
2. Retriever searches for query-specific data
3. AnswerAssistant generates contextual response
4. Updates conversation thread with Q&A

### 2. Report Generation Flow
```http
POST /api/files/generate-report
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "sessionId": "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3",
  "reportTitle": "Research Session Report",
  "includeFileData": true,
  "includeLiveData": true,
  "searchLimit": 20
}
```

**Processing Flow:**
1. Extract conversation history from session
2. QueryRefiner with report mode prompts (all topics)
3. Retriever searches with comprehensive query
4. AnswerAssistant generates structured report
5. Returns report without updating conversation thread

### 3. Report Preview
```http
GET /api/files/report-preview/60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Shows what questions will be covered and estimated topics before generating the full report.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### QueryRefiner Dual Mode

#### Normal Mode System Prompt
```
You are a query optimization expert for semantic search systems. 
Your task is to refine user queries to improve retrieval accuracy...

Focus on: Single query optimization, current context, specific search terms
```

#### Report Mode System Prompt
```
You are a comprehensive report query optimizer. 
Your task is to create a single optimized search query that captures 
ALL topics and concepts from an entire conversation history...

Focus on: All conversation topics, comprehensive coverage, broad search terms
```

### AnswerAssistant Dual Mode

#### Normal Mode Response
- Uses `generateResponseWithSources()`
- Contextual, conversational tone
- Focused on current query
- Updates conversation thread
- Moderate response length

#### Report Mode Response  
- Uses `generateReportWithSources()`
- Professional, structured format
- Covers all conversation questions
- Read-only (no thread updates)
- Comprehensive response length

## üìä Report Structure

Reports follow a standardized structure:

```markdown
# Research Report

## Executive Summary
[Brief overview of all topics covered and key findings]

## Detailed Analysis

### Topic 1: [First major topic]
[Detailed answer with sources]

### Topic 2: [Second major topic] 
[Detailed answer with sources]

[Continue for all topics...]

## Key Findings and Conclusions
[Summary of most important discoveries and insights]

## Sources Referenced
[Complete list of all sources cited in the report]
```

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Chat Session Example
```javascript
// User asks questions interactively
await fetch('/api/files/research-answer', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What is machine learning?",
    sessionId: sessionId
  })
});

// Follow-up question
await fetch('/api/files/research-answer', {
  method: 'POST', 
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "How is it used in healthcare?",
    sessionId: sessionId
  })
});

// Generate final report covering all questions
await fetch('/api/files/generate-report', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    sessionId: sessionId,
    reportTitle: "Machine Learning in Healthcare Report"
  })
});
```
